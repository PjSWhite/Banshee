This repository contains the KiCAD + FreeCAD files for a new capstone
which we have pivoted to.

## 3D FreeCAD models

I won't be exporting STL/STEP/3MF files for this project since I
am lazy, but the project files themselves are available:

* At the time of writing, there is a *Antenna Mount.FCStd* file
  which is the FreeCAD project for, you guessed it, an antenna mount!
  I needed something to keep the antenna upright during active
  testing, so I decided to whip up a mount for the antenna

* Later on, the FreeCAD files for the housing will be released
  once I begin making them.

## PCB Files

PCB files are placed under the `pcb/` directory, and the bulk of
the repository's commits are because of this fella

## License

Firmware and project files are released to the public under the
GPL 3.0 license in the hopes that future researchers may iterate
upon the botched system that this lone mad scientist has gone
ahead and created. Along with the GPL stuff, please do credit me
Ivan Leonard Aparte <ivanleonard.aparte@cit.edu> as the creator
and copyright holder of this piece of (albeit fucked) engineering.
